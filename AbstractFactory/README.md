# Abstract Factory Pattern

A factory (previously manufactory) or
manufacturing plant is an industrial building
where workers manufacture goods or
supervise machines processing one product
into another.
â€“ wikipedia

The purpose of the Abstract Factory is
to provide an interface for creating
families of related objects, without
specifying concrete classes.
