 * The engine is the source of motive power to an automobile. Obviously,
 * it is a very important part of the automobile because in the absence
 * of an engine, the automobile may not move at all, and its basic
 * function of transporting passengers or goods would be defeated.
 *
 * The power of the engine determines the working of the automobile. In
 * the same manner, the efficiency of the engine determines the efficiency
 * of an automobile.
 *
 * The engine, nowadays, is invariably an internal combustion engine. This
 * may be a spark-ignition engine consuming petrol as fuel.
 *
 * Alternatively, it could be a compression ignition engine using diesel as fuel.
 *
 * The engines used are multi-cylinder engines. A single-cylinder engine,
 * though capable of providing the desired power may become very heavy and
 * therefore may be unsuitable.
 *
 * In a multi-cylinder engine, each cylinder handling a smaller amount of
 * power may keep engine light in weight. In an internal combustion engine,
 * total heat produced by the burning of fuel is not converted into work.
 *
 * Part of it causes over-all heating of engine which is undesirable. This
 * heat is to be dissipated properly. Coolant in the form of air or water may
 * be used to take away this heat.
 *
 * So an engine can be air-cooled or water-cooled. These days some chemicals
 * have been developed which have a cooling property, and these remain
 * unaffected for a longer period of time.
 *
 * These chemicals are being used as coolants, and these do not require
 * frequent replacement. Apart from their long life, they are more efficient also.
 *
 * Similarly, lubrication is another aspect to be taken care of in an engine
 * requiring periodic attention from the user.
 *
 * The moving parts in an engine need regular lubrication to reduce unwanted
 * friction. The chemistry of lubricant is now highly developed. There is a standard
 * rating for lubricants and for every purpose a specific lubricant is available.
