 * The transmission system transmits power developed by the engine to the road wheels. The power available as output from the engine is in the form of rotation of the crankshaft.
 *
 * This movement is to be transferred to the road wheels to cause their rotary motion. Their rotary motion makes possible the movement of the vehicle.
 *
 * The transmission system consists of different parts. These include clutch, gearbox, propeller shaft, differential and axle, live axle to be more precise.
 *
 * The road wheels are at the ends of the axle. The motion is transmitted through these parts. Every part of the transmission system performs its own function.
 *
 * i. Clutch.
 *
 * The clutch, part of the transmission system is next to the crankshaft. It is a mechanism enabling the rotary motion of one shaft transmitted to the second shaft ‘at will.’
 *
 * When the engine starts, it should not be connected to road wheels, i.e., these should not start moving as soon as the engine starts.
 *
 * Secondly, this motion should be smoothly transferred so that passengers in the car do not feel discomfort, and its mechanism is not spoiled.
 *
 * In the case of vehicles used for the transportation of goods, the smooth transmission process is essential as otherwise, it may cause damage to goods.
 *
 * ii. Gearbox.
 *
 * The gearbox is the component of the transmission system next to the clutch. It has got a gear train, and it provides different gear ratios. These ratios determine the rotary speed of output shaft from the gearbox.
 *
 * The torque transmitted to the road wheels gives rise to a propulsive force or (tractive effort) between these and the road. When starting from rest, a large tractive effort is required.
 *
 * This makes essential the introduction of considerable ‘leverage’ between the engine and the wheels so that torque from the engine, which is almost constant, produces the large tractive effort.
 *
 * This ‘leverage’ is provided by the gearbox.
 *
 * Different gear ratios available in the gearbox can provide the required tractive effort to overcome the resistance faced by the automobile under different conditions.
 *
 * Propeller shaft transmits the output from the gearbox to the axle. This axle may be in the rear or in the front or in some cases both the rear and front axle may receive output from the gearbox.
 *
 * The output from the gearbox is in the form of rotary motion of the shaft, and this motion is transferred to the axle.
 *
 * iii. Differential.
 *
 * The differential is the next component of the transmission system. The motion of propeller shaft is fed to the differential which turns it through 90 degrees. This is essential as the axle is at 90 degrees to the propeller shaft.
 *
 * The function is performed with the help of a pinion and a gear. Another important function of the differential is to reduce the speed of inner wheels and at the same time, enhance the speed of outer wheels by the same amount.
 *
 * This is required when the automobile is moving on a curved path. On a curved path, the outer wheels are required to traverse a circle of a bigger radius than the inner wheels.
 *
 * This means that the outer wheels are required to traverse larger distance as compared to inner wheels. As the automobile is to move as a single unit, all the four wheels must travel together.
 *
 * Therefore, the outer wheels should travel larger distance and inner wheels should travel smaller distance in the same time period.
 *
 *
 * Hence, the variation in the speed of inner and outer wheels is needed. This is performed by the differential with the help of sun and planet gear system.

 *
 * iv. Axle.
 *
 * The axle is the next component of the transmission system. The axle receiving power from the engine is termed as ‘live’ axle. It is in two halves.
 *
 * The ends of the axle have road wheels connected to it. These road wheels are in direct contact with the road surface. The body of the automobile is above the axle.
 *
 * The axle also takes up the various loads including the weight of the automobile. It also transmits motion to the road wheels.
