 * The use of a separate frame to which the body structure is attached is
 * now almost obsolete except for some applications for heavy-duty commercial vehicles.
 *
 * Many heavy vehicles now use ‘sub-frames’ of simple construction to
 * which the engine and gearbox are attached.
 *
 * The sub-frame is supported on the mainframe and is fixed on it through some
 * suitable rubber connections to isolate the engine vibrations.
 *
 * Due to development in spot welding and sheet pressing techniques, most of
 * the vehicles have integral construction. All the assembly units of the
 * vehicles are attached to the body, which also acts the frame.
 *
 * It makes the vehicle compact, lightweight, and also its cost is reduced.
 * Some intermediate designs using a light chassis and a pressed steel body
 * are also in use.
 *
 * The light chassis, in such designs, is strengthened by using platform made
 * of a sheet of steel. Apart from the four basic components described above,
 * the automobile has the control systems and auxiliaries.
 *
 * The control systems are used to control the motion of an automobile and
 * therefore are essential in an automobile. These include;
 *
 * i. Steering system.
 *
 * The automobile, while moving, may be required to traverse a circular path.
 * It has to be turned through some angle if the path is not straight.
 *
 * There may be other situations also when the road is turning towards left or
 * right, and an automobile is required to turn to left or right.
 *
 * This turning of the automobile towards left or right or on the curved
 * path is provided through steering mechanism.
 *
 * The steering system is required to be quite accurate as the automobile
 * should turn accurately along with the path.
 *
 * ii. Braking system.
 *
 * This causes a reduction in speed of the vehicle and brings it to rest
 * when necessary. Bringing an automobile to rest is as important as its movement.
 *
 * Obviously, when we have reached our destination, we would like to stop;
 * and therefore, the vehicle should come to rest.
 *
 *
 * Also, there may be some kind of emergency and vehicle may be required to
 * slow down or stop on the way. At that time, also its motion is to be controlled.
 *
 * This control on the motion is provided with the help of brakes.
 *
 * 5. The Auxiliaries.
 *
 * These are the components of an automobile which may not be essential, but it
 * can make the driving more comfortable.
 *
 * The fact is that with the passage of time, some auxiliaries become essential.
 * A few years back, the indicators—to indicate the turning vehicle—were not used.
 * But now these have been made mandatory by the government.
 *
 * Though air-conditioner is not essential and is just to provide comfort conditions,
 * now it is provided in every vehicle in developed countries and is being adopted
 * by more and more people.
 *
 * The study of automobile engineering involves going through an in-depth study of
 * all the components and parts of automobile.
 *
 * These include engine, transmission system, control, and auxiliaries system.
 *
 * The engine used in an automobile is an internal combustion engine. The
 * transmission system consists of a number of parts, the introduction of
 * which has already been presented.
 *
 * Suspension systems, wheels, and tires are also important components, parts of
 * automobile. Study of steering mechanism and brakes is also important as these
 * form the control system in an automobile.
