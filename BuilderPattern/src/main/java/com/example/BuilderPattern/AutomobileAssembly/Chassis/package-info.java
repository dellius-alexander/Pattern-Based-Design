/**
 * <pre>
 * The chassis of an automobile incorporates all the major assemblies
 * consisting of an engine, components of transmission system such as
 * clutch, gearbox, propeller shaft, axles, a control system such as
 * brakes and steering, and suspension system of the vehicle.
 *
 * In other words, it is the vehicle without its body.
 *
 * The chassis of an automobile has the frame, suspension system, axles,
 * and wheel as the main components. The frame could be in the form of
 * conventional chassis or unit construction may be adopted.
 *
 * In a conventional chassis frame, the frame forms the main skeleton of
 * vehicle. It supports engine, power transmission, and car body.
 *
 * The frame is supported on wheels and axles through springs. The frame
 * carries the weight of the vehicle and passengers, withstands engine,
 * transmission, accelerating, and braking torques.
 *
 * It also withstands the centrifugal forces while cornering and takes up
 * stresses due to the rise and fall of axles.
 *
 * In the unit construction type, there is no frame. The structure of the
 * body of the automobile is first formed, and then different components
 * such as the engine, transmission system, and other parts are placed at
 * suitable places in the body structure.
 *
 * The transmission system itself consists of a number of parts such as
 * clutch assembly, gearbox, propeller shaft, differential, and axles.
 *
 * The other parts include the interior details which are utilized by the
 * passengers and driver of the vehicle. Through suitable designing, the
 * parts are so arranged that they provide maximum comfort and make
 * journeys in the automobile enjoyable.
 *
 * The other parts of the chassis are suspension system, axles, and wheel.
 * The suspension system absorbs the vibrations due to up and down movement of wheels.
 *
 * Springs and shock absorbers connecting the frame and the axle perform
 * this function. The springs can be leaf spring, coil spring, or torsion
 * bar. Even rubber or air can form the material of springs.
 *
 * The wheels of the vehicle can be suspended independently on springs or
 * on spring-suspended axles. The axle may be ‘live’ if power from the
 * engine is transmitted to it.
 *
 * It may be a ‘dead’ axle if no power is supplied to it and it is just
 * supporting the weight of the vehicle. In ‘four-wheel drive,’ the power
 * is supplied to both the axles and therefore both the axles are ‘live.’
 *
 * In addition to providing support to the weight of the vehicle, the axle
 * also resists the stresses due to braking and driving torque.
