 * Secrets management is the practice of protecting secrets, such as
 * passwords, API keys, and certificates, in a secure and organized
 * manner. It is an important aspect of cybersecurity, as secrets are
 * often used to access sensitive systems and data.
 *
 * There are various approaches to secret management, including storing
 * secrets in configuration files, using environmental variables, and
 * storing secrets in a dedicated secrets management system.
 *
 * A secrets management system is a secure storage location for secrets
 * that is accessed through APIs or other secure methods. It allows for
 * the secure storage, management, and rotation of secrets, as well as
 * the ability to easily revoke and replace secrets as needed.
 *
 * Effective secret management is crucial for maintaining the security
 * of systems and data, as well as for compliance with various industry
 * regulations and standards.
